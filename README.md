# Ludum Dare #37 Jam entry
This is [my entry](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=4623) in the [Ludum Dare](http://www.ldjam.com) #37 Jam category. I had *very* limited time this weekend, but at least I managed to finish something. The theme was One room so I went with a single room with procedurally generated inner wall (cellular automata) and randmly spawning enemies. Unfortunately only a single kind of enemy and only two weapons, the AK-97 and the four barelled shortgun.

## Controls
* WASD or arrows to move
* MOUSE to aim and fire
* R to reload
