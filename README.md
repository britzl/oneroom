# Ludum Dare #37 Jam entry
This is [my entry](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=4623) in the [Ludum Dare](http://www.ldjam.com) #37 Jam category. I had *very* limited time this weekend, but at least I managed to finish something. The theme was One Room so I went with a single room with procedurally generated inner walls (cellular automata) and randomly spawning enemies. Unfortunately only a single kind of enemy and only two weapons, the AK-97 and the four barelled shortgun.

The game has been worked on since Ludum Dare. The LD Jam entry can be found in this commit: https://github.com/britzl/oneroom/tree/69d201ac6bbfa15a375b01d2f46da70f0d3a3e9f
